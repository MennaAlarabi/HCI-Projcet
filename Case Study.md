# UI/UX Redesign Case Study
## Introduction  
This report presents a detailed UI/UX audit and redesign strategy for the NOPWASD
website, National Organization for Potable Water and Sanitary Drainage, a governmental platform responsible for providing information related to potable water and sanitary drainage projects in Egypt.
The existing website suffers from multiple usability, accessibility, and interface design issues that negatively affect user satisfaction and efficiency.
The purpose of this case study is to transform a legacy digital interface characterized by
outdated aesthetics and critical functional failures into a modern, user-centric platform.  
By addressing core usability issues and implementing a robust design system, the redesign
significantly enhances information accessibility, user engagement, and the organization's
digital authority.  

## Problem Statment
The NOPWASD website lacks a user-centered design approach. Users face difficulties in navigating the site, understanding content structure, and completing common tasks efficiently. The interface design is outdated and inconsistent, while the user experience suffers from high cognitive load, weak information architecture, and poor accessibility support.  
The current interface does not adequately support older users, who represent a significant portion of governmental website visitors.  

## User Interface Analysis (UI)
The old UI suffered from an outdated aesthetic and a lack of consistency, where the design
elements no longer aligned with the organization's professional stature.
